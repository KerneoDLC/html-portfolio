<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>My name is Kevin and I'm an aspiring coder and future Computer Science student. This has been a long time dream of mine and I'm going to work at it and improve every single day.</p>

<p>I was born the 6th of August 1996 in Naples, Italy. My parents are originally from the Philippines but I lived here all my life.<br /> I've always been passionate about computers and the Internet since I was a kid and now at age 26 I decided to make my passion as my occupation. I also have other hobbies/interest such as skateboarding, videogames and sports.<br /> When I was 14 I had my first taste at coding, in particular with HTML, through build my own ForumCommunity. By copying and learning about anchoring and images through other users and forums. Having base knowledge of the tools in the Photoshop application suite, creating logos and banner to get affiliated to other bigger forums and getting more clicks and views on my own forum.<br /> The forum's name was File Crash and it was a place where user could get free software and game, albeit through illegal means, exchange conversation about games, getting help for troubleshoot and such.</p>
